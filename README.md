Recursive descent parsing for very basic maths expressions.

These two resources were pretty helpful for getting started:
- [Video: recursive descent parsing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SToUyjAsaFk)
- [This MIT licensed lexer](https://gist.github.com/arrieta/1a309138689e09375b90b3b1aa768e20) could be a helpful reference too.
